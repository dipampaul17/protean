From **Microsoft Copilot** to the launch of a new **Azure SRE Agent** , PagerDuty was highlighted as a strategic partner in enabling intelligent, scalable incident response.\n\n##### **Bringing the power of PagerDuty to Microsoft Copilot**\n\nPagerDuty’s presence at Build reflects our growing alignment with Microsoft’s vision of an agent-powered workplace. Across multiple sessions and announcements, Microsoft showcased how PagerDuty helps extend AI-powered orchestration into real-time operational workflows:\n\n  * **Satya Nadella’s keynote** and [**Srini Raghavan’s blog**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/microsoft365copilotblog/microsoft-build-2025-how-to-create-a-%E2%80%9Cfrontier%E2%80%9D-workplace-powered-by-agents/4414287) identified PagerDuty as part of the **Microsoft 365 Copilot ecosystem** , illustrating how organizations can directly surface real-time signals from PagerDuty in their workflow.\n  * Microsoft [introduced](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-copilot/blog/copilot-studio/multi-agent-orchestration-maker-controls-and-more-microsoft-copilot-studio-announcements-at-microsoft-build-2025/) a new [**PagerDuty Copilot Connector**](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftsearch/pagerduty-schedules-connector) , which enables users to bring on-call schedules and escalation policies into the Copilot experience—empowering faster, more context-aware incident response.\n  * Microsoft also announced the new [**Azure SRE Agent**](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurepaasblog/introducing-azure-sre-agent/4414569) , purpose-built to integrate with the **PagerDuty Operations Cloud**. This agent leverages PagerDuty’s real-time data capabilities to help classify, escalate, and resolve incidents before they impact customers.\n\n##### **Driving real-time operational resilience with PagerDuty Advance AI Agents**\n\nPagerDuty’s mission is to revolutionize operations and build trust by anticipating the unexpected in an unpredictable world. Our **Operations Cloud** combines **AIOps** , **Automation** , **Incident Management** , **PagerDuty Advance** , and **Customer Service Operations** ; we help teams detect and resolve issues faster, reducing downtime, protecting revenue, and improving customer experience.\n\nOur collaboration with Microsoft is a reflection of this mission in action. Together, we’re:\n\n  * Extending operational context into Microsoft Copilot\n  * Activating intelligent AI agents to manage service health at scale\n  * Helping joint customers move from reactive to proactive operations\n\n##### **Looking ahead**\n\nAI and automation are transforming how critical work gets done. As enterprises invest in resilient, scalable operations, we’re proud to partner with Microsoft to power intelligent response and proactive issue management through integrated platforms and agentic AI.\n\n🔗 [Learn more about the Azure SRE Agent  \n](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/blog/azurepaasblog/introducing-azure-sre-agent/4414569)🔗 [Explore the PagerDuty Copilot Connector

Whether connecting individuals to crisis counselors via text or coordinating face-to-face healthcare support, these digital services must operate seamlessly. In today’s environment of funding cuts and serious resource constraints, organizations need always-on systems powered by automation and AI to maximize their impact.\n\nSince its inception in 2019, [PagerDuty.org](http://pagerduty.org) has supported organizations on the front-lines of time-critical health. PagerDuty plays a unique role by increasing access to critical, quality care, and mobilizing core resources to help enable non-profits to fulfill their mission.\n\nToday, we are announcing the nine organizations that make up our latest Impact Cohort to advance health outcomes through crisis helplines and response services. Through this program, these tech-forward organizations will receive comprehensive support from PagerDuty, which includes general operating funding, platform credits, technical pro bono support from our employees, and impact storytelling opportunities. \n\nDuring the next year, each organization will utilize the [PagerDuty Operations Cloud](https://www.pagerduty.com/platform/operations-cloud/) to transform incident management, leverage AI and Automation to improve workflows, and prioritize urgent issues to ensure that their critical services are available around the clock. Our investment and partnership aim to help these organizations remove manual operational tasks and spend more time scaling their services to serve the growing needs in their communities.\n\nThe PagerDuty investments will help selected partners build AI readiness and adoption, achieve greater operational efficiency, in service of their critical missions\n\n**Meet the Partners:**\n\n[AccesSOS](https://accessos.io/) is a life-saving tech solution that simplifies messaging emergency services, especially for those who are deaf, hard of hearing or do not speak English, making contacting 911 more accessible for everyone. Because the United States 911 system is heavily voice-and-English-centric, it leaves behind 37 million Americans who are deaf, hard-of-hearing, speak limited English, or unable to safely make a voice call during a crisis. Only 50% of 911 centers support text-to-911, and few offer quick language access. accesSOS’s crisis response program exists to close that gap by providing a mobile app that enables people in distress to request help using an icon and text-based interface, share their location, and receive support without speaking or using English.\n\nWith this grant, accesSOS will serve the growing demand, expanding to more communities affected by climate-related disasters and public safety threats, while also strengthening the back-end infrastructure for real-time responsiveness, improving system uptime, and alerting in high-traffic emergency periods. Additionally, it will accelerate the development of an AI-powered real-time language translation feature, ensuring 911 dispatchers can receive and understand emergency messages in more than 30 languages.\n\n[Crisis Text Line](https://www.crisistextline.org/) is a leading nonprofit organization that provides free, 24/7, confidential text-based mental health support in English and Spanish by texting HELLO or HOLA to 741741. Since its launch in 2013, the organization has supported over 11 million conversations in the United States and more than 15 million internationally together with its affiliates in Canada, the UK, and Ireland. Crisis Text Line has trained over 85,000 volunteers in the U.S. and over 100,000 globally who provide mental health support for individuals facing various challenges, including stress, anxiety, loneliness, isolation, difficult relationships, bullying, self-harm, and suicidal thoughts.\n\nPagerDuty’s investment will help Crisis Text Line accelerate international growth in global coverage of the platform. Currently, Crisis Text Line serves 500M people or 5% of the globe in the U.S. and Canada, the UK and Ireland with international affiliate partners. Ultimately, the goal is to serve 25% of the globe in the next five years.\n\n[Empower Work](https://www.empowerwork.org/) Empower Work is a national nonprofit that provides a free, confidential text line focused on improving the well-being of historically marginalized, low-income individuals navigating workplace challenges. Their unique coaching and resources that meet workers where they are supports increased confidence, clarity, agency, empowerment, and economic security – all rooted in equity. Over 94% [of those seeking help] report improved mental health and over 80% improved financial security.\n\nPagerDuty’s investment will directly support Empower Work’s digital transformation journey in operational resilience and AI adoption. As such, the organization will accelerate the roll out of an AI Assistant designed to reduce counselor cognitive load and automate tasks like summarizing sessions and recommending vetted resources, as well as suggestions to move a conversation forward towards positive outcomes for help seekers. Based on research and internal testing, this will increase session capacity by 30–50% and reduce reliance on costly human supervisors, doubling the reach of sessions per month within a year.\n\n[Intelehealth](https://intelehealth.org/) improves health outcomes for women and their families at the last mile through telemedicine. They offer a proven 6-step implementation methodology and an open-source, AI-enabled software platform for governments and healthcare nonprofits to transform traditional brick-and-mortar health systems into “brick-and-click” telemedicine-powered models of care. \n\nOver the past year, the organization has completed 8.75 million teleconsultations, supported over 18,000 frontline health workers and 10,000 doctors. They have a bold vision to enable 100 million teleconsultations in the next five years. By integrating AI to lower costs and raise care quality, Intelehealth will help public health systems scale services more efficiently. PagerDuty support will be the key to taking the first critical steps by focusing on two strategic priorities: Improving the Platform Reliability & Resilience and Incident Response and Performance & Stability.\n\n[Mercy Corps](https://www.mercycorps.org/) Mercy Corps is a global community of humanitarians working to create a future where everyone can prosper. Over the last 25 years, they have responded to over 100 emergencies —supporting communities affected by conflict, displacement, natural disasters, climate change, and other crises. In 2023, in collaboration with local partners, they reached 8.3 million people with essential water, sanitation, and hygiene support and provided 15.8 million people with access to safe and nutritious food. Nearly 86% of Mercy Corps’ team members live in the communities where they serve, building trust with people across more than 40 countries. From rapid needs assessments to critical early interventions, Mercy Corps’ focuses on meeting critical needs while supporting communities to build long-term resilience.\n\nSupport from PagerDuty will strengthen the preparedness of frontline emergency responders —helping ensure they can act quickly and effectively when crises emerge. Together, we will also enact anticipatory interventions intended to blunt the impact of an emergency, including stockpiling staff and supplies at strategic locations and engaging digital solutions like sending cash payments and emergency information before a disaster strikes. Investing in preparedness today reduces harm tomorrow—and helps build a more resilient world.\n\n[SIRUM](https://sirum.org/) drives the future of healthcare by connecting people with surplus medicine. They help hospitals, pharmacies, and nursing homes donate their unused, unexpired medicine and get it to where it’s needed most. For medicine donors, the program works like recycling. Using custom technology, they divert the unexpired, life-saving medicine from being dumped, flushed, or burnt and get it to people in need by automating a courier pick-up and logistics. For patients, the program provides life-saving medicine that they otherwise couldn’t access for free or at a low cost. Through their partner network and their own pharmacy service Good Pill, they offer a consistent supply of 500+ of the most common medications, which cover 75% of all drugs prescribed (excluding opioids). As the nation’s largest redistributor of surplus medicine, SIRUM has redistributed $300M+ of medicine to more than 500,000 patients.\n\nSIRUM’s work to connect patients in need with surplus medicine is needed now more than ever. Healthcare costs are rising faster than general inflation with three in ten adults skipping medicine because of cost. With shifting policies and budget cuts likely to alter the U.S. social safety net, more and more people will face rising out-of-pocket drug costs and barriers to accessing the medicine they need to stay healthy. With support from PagerDuty, SIRUM will scale their impact during this pivotal year – meeting rising demand, deepening innovation and setting the foundation for national expansion.\n\n[Trek Medics International](https://trekmedics.org/) is a nonprofit organization transforming access to emergency response networks in communities worldwide through mobile phone technologies. Through its Beacon crisis response platform, built using the PagerDuty Operations Cloud, responders can alert, coordinate, and track emergency response networks on any mobile phone with or without internet, ultimately reducing response times and saving lives. \n\nWith support from PagerDuty, Trek Medics will undergo a major expansion of their services and reach in Los Angeles, California, Colombia, the UK, and Belize. Specifically, they launched their largest program to date in partnership with [Tech Matters](https://techmatters.org/) for the CIRCLE program in the City of LA, an unarmed crisis response program focused on the homeless population that currently covers 40% of the city and averages 80 crisis response incidents per day. \n\nTrek Medics will also ensure they’re able to complete and pass the SOC 2 Type 1 audit, hire administrative staff, and dedicate time to support the implementation of a custom script builder within Beacon that would be used by dispatchers during call intake to follow structured interviews, thus standardizing interactions between callers and dispatchers. \n\n[World Central Kitchen](https://wck.org/) is first to the frontlines, providing fresh meals in response to humanitarian, climate, and community crises. Their critical relief work includes providing fresh and culturally appropriate meals, working alongside community leaders to best understand the local dynamics, investing in impacted communities by purchasing from local vendors, hiring catering partners and local staff to support WCK operations and working with local chefs, logisticians and team members to meet the unique needs of the community. By applying their model of quick action, leveraging local resources, and adapting in real time, WCK has served more than 450 million nourishing meals around the world. \n\nPagerDuty’s investment will enable WCK to provide approximately 20,000 nourishing meals to crisis-affected communities, while also allowing WCK to explore AI technologies that can assist the team’s abilities to streamline and automate processes.\n\n[Youth ALIVE!](https://www.youthalive.org/) is a direct-service public health organization based in Oakland, California. Its mission is to break the cycle of violence, heal trauma, and uplift a thriving community of leaders, to save lives in Oakland and beyond. A PagerDuty customer since 2021, Youth ALIVE! has used PagerDuty’s Incident Management product to replace a manual, high-stress dispatch system with an automated response process that ensures critical information reaches the right intervention teams in real time. This has reduced response times, increased staff efficiency, and supported meaningful impact: in 2024, Its Hospital-Based Violence Intervention program (HVIP) Caught in the Crossfire program served 113 violently wounded clients, with 98% avoiding rehospitalization. Our Violence Interrupters conducted 424 conflict mediations, helping drive a 34% citywide reduction in shootings and homicides compared to 2023. This downward trend has continued into 2025, with Oakland still experiencing violence rates nearly 30% lower than the prior year to date.\n\nSupport from PagerDuty will help sustain Youth ALIVE!’s life-saving programs and strengthen operational excellence and AI capabilities to meet the urgent and evolving needs of our community. This includes the Khadafy Washington Project (KWP), which sends trained responders into the immediate aftermath of every Oakland homicide to support grieving families. In 2024, KWP served 86 families, offering emotional care, emergency financial assistance, relocation services, victim compensation support, and healing circles. PagerDuty’s partnership ensures we can continue building safer, healthier communities from the ground up.  \n\n–\n\nPagerDuty.org empowers mission-driven teams to build a more equitable world and sustainable future. Our spring investments will help partners build AI readiness and adoption, resilience, achieve greater efficiency, and continue delivering critical services at scale when their communities need them most.

Their pitch is appealing: one platform to eliminate context switching and reduce overhead. But when critical systems fail—and they will fail—, add-on incident management modules won’t save you. You need an end-to-end system built specifically for high-stakes incident management.\n\n#### The Limitations of Monitoring Add-Ons\n\nTacking incident management onto a monitoring tool is like relying on a smoke alarm to put out a fire. While it might tell you there’s a problem, it won’t stop the damage. Add-on modules from vendors like Datadog and Grafana are lacking in a few key areas:\n\n  * **Basic Response Capabilities:** Datadog’s incident response scratches the surface of basic capabilities, like on-call, escalation, and retrospectives, but lacks the orchestration and proven workflows needed for complex, time-sensitive incidents.\n  * **Narrow Signal Integration:** Relying on a single observability vendor creates dangerous blind spots. You might see a metric spike but miss the underlying change in deployments or configuration, customer impact, or how this incident relates to issues you’ve faced in the past. Without diverse signal sources, teams miss crucial context that could speed up resolution.\n  * **Cost Structure:** While consolidated tooling promises efficiency, the reality often includes unexpected cost escalation, opaque pricing, and vendor lock-in that impacts long-term flexibility.\n  * **Product Focus:** Incident management requires dedicated development and innovation. When it’s treated as an add-on module or side project, your operational resilience suffers.\n\n#### The Case for a Purpose-Built Incident Management Platform \n\nUnlike some observability vendors, PagerDuty doesn’t bolt on incident management as an afterthought. When the unexpected strikes, the difference between chaos and control lies in having a dedicated incident management platform that takes your operations seriously, ensuring that your business remains resilient, costs stay in check, and your customer experience isn’t compromised. We partner with like-minded organizations that make operational resilience a top priority.\n\nThere’s a reason two-thirds of Fortune 100 companies trust PagerDuty with their critical operations. Our platform delivers:\n\n  * **Purpose-built incident management that scales with your needs:** Incident management isn’t our side project—it’s our core mission. Our platform handles the complete incident lifecycle, from initial detection through resolution and learning. Built-in workflows and custom incident types automatically orchestrate response across teams, while our advanced Slack and Microsoft Teams integrations provide a unified experience that keeps responders focused on resolution, not coordination. Integrated post-incident reviews ensure that every event becomes a learning opportunity to enhance future resilience.\n  * **Intelligent automation and continuous platform innovation:** AI-powered automation is woven into every stage of incident management. Our platform can adapt its approach—fully automated for well-understood issues, fully human-powered with AI assistance for new and novel issues, and hybrid for partially understood cases. Our ongoing innovation in incident management, with features like automated diagnostics, intelligent alert suppression, and our upcoming autonomous AI agents, is designed to help teams resolve incidents faster and more effectively.\n  * **Enterprise-grade reliability and flexibility:** With 700+ partner integrations, we want all our customers to seamlessly integrate whatever tools they want to use. And with best-in-class, 99.9% web availability SLAs, we make sure we’re up when you go down so you’re covered on your worst days.\n\n#### Best of Both Worlds: Seamless Integration for Maximum Visibility\n\nSuccessful digital operations aren’t about choosing between great monitoring and great incident management—they’re about having both working seamlessly together.\n\nModern operations demand a rich observability ecosystem partnered with robust incident management to power continuous operations and high availability of critical services. Organizations that maintain flexibility across vendors and tools can adapt quickly as new monitoring needs emerge, from security monitoring to LLMOps and beyond. PagerDuty serves as your centralized hub, making it seamless to integrate new tools and swap vendors as your needs evolve. This dynamic approach ensures you never miss critical signals and can continuously enhance your monitoring capabilities without being constrained by a single vendor’s ecosystem.\n\nPagerDuty was built from the ground up to handle high-stakes operations. It integrates seamlessly with Datadog, Grafana, and 700+ other tools to provide a bird’s eye view across your ecosystem, paired with the intelligence to filter signals from noise, driving action in critical moments.\n\n[Start a free trial today](http://www.pagerduty.com/sign-up) and experience the difference purpose-built incident management makes when integrated with your existing observability

As millions across the Iberian Peninsula found themselves suddenly disconnected, a stark reality emerged: in our interconnected world, the ripple effects of major incidents extend far beyond their immediate impact zone.\n\n##### **Yet Another Wake-Up Call**\n\nThis isn’t just another outage story. It’s a powerful reminder of what [our recent survey](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/insights/learn/execs-expecting-it-outages-2025/) revealed: 88% of executives expect an incident of a similar scale as the [July 2024 global IT outage](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/lessons-in-reliability/) this year. The Iberian Peninsula outage proves they’re right – it’s no longer a question of if, but when. And just last week, a computer network failure shut down the entire BART system in San Francisco, stranding 40,000 commuters.\n\nBut what makes this Iberian Peninsula incident particularly noteworthy isn’t just its scale – affecting over 60 million people – but how it exposed the intricate dependencies in our modern infrastructure. When the power grid failed, it wasn’t just lights that went out. Telecommunications dropped to 17% of normal capacity. Banking systems went offline. Transportation networks ground to a halt. This cascade of failures demonstrates why traditional approaches to reliability aren’t enough anymore.\n\n##### **Beyond the Myth of Perfect Prevention**\n\nThere’s a common misconception in our industry that with enough redundancy and preventive measures, we can make systems failproof. This outage teaches us otherwise. As we saw during last year’s global IT outage, organizations that thrived weren’t those that tried to prevent every possible failure – they were the ones prepared to respond effectively when incidents occurred.\n\nDuring that previous global incident, PagerDuty’s platform processed over 60,000 notifications per minute while maintaining our 15-second average notification time. This wasn’t luck – it was the result of systematic preparation and the right tools in place.\n\n##### **Real Resilience in Action**\n\nNow, you may ask: what does effective incident management look like in practice? Let’s break it down:\n\n  * **Early Warning Systems Matter:** The Iberian outage began with grid oscillations at 12:03 CEST, but the system collapsed 30 minutes later. PagerDuty’s AIOps can help teams detect and respond to such anomalies before they cascade into major incidents:\n\n  *     * Using machine learning to identify patterns and potential issues\n    * Providing automated alert grouping to reduce noise\n    * Offering intelligent alert routing to the right teams\n    * Delivering context-rich notifications for faster resolution  \n\n  * **Automation is Your First Responder:** During the July 2024 outage, our customers who leveraged PagerDuty’s automation capabilities saw a 1425% increase in automation usage, allowing them to handle routine tasks while human responders focused on critical decision-making. This same principle applies to power grid management and infrastructure monitoring. Our platform enables:\n\n  *     * Automated incident classification and prioritization\n    * Pre-built response playbooks for common scenarios\n    * Intelligent workflow automation\n    * Automated stakeholder communications\n    * Integration with over 700+ tools and services  \n\n  * **Coordinated Response is Critical:** The Spain and Portugal incident required coordination between multiple power grid operators, emergency services, and government agencies across two countries. Our [end-to-end incident management platform](https://www.pagerduty.com/platform/incident-management/) ensures clear communication channels and structured workflows when every second counts thanks to:\n\n  1.      * Real-time collaboration tools\n     * Structured incident command protocols\n     * Automated escalation policies\n     * Stakeholder updates and Status Pages\n     * Mobile-first design for on-the-go response\n\n##### **Building Tomorrow ’s Resilience Today**\n\n[Recent data](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/insights/learn/execs-expecting-it-outages-2025/) shows that 86% of leaders recognize they’ve been prioritizing security at the expense of operational readiness. The Iberian Peninsula outage reinforces what we’ve long advocated – resilience requires a holistic approach that combines:\n\n  * Real-time monitoring and early warning systems\n  * Automated response capabilities\n  * Clear incident management protocols\n  * Cross-team coordination tools\n  * Continuous testing and improvement\n\nAs we analyze this incident, one thing becomes clear: the organizations that weather major outages most effectively are those that have invested in modern incident management capabilities. They understand that resilience isn’t about preventing every possible failure – it’s about building systems and processes that can detect, respond to, and recover from incidents quickly and effectively.\n\nAt PagerDuty, we’ve seen how organizations that embrace this approach consistently outperform during major incidents. During the July 2024 outage, our customers resolved incidents just 29% slower than on a normal day, despite a 192% spike in incident volume. This is the kind of resilience every organization needs in today’s interconnected world.\n\n##### **Taking Action**\n\nThe Iberian power outage serves as a timely reminder that major incidents are inevitable. The question isn’t whether your organization will face a similar challenge, but [how prepared you’ll be when it happens](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/are-you-prepared-for-your-next-major-outage/). With the right tools, processes, and mindset, you can build the resilience needed to maintain service continuity even in the face of major disruptions.\n\nWant to learn more about preparing for outages?

But organizations that attempt to improve operational efficiency and drive profits via layoffs and short-term cost-cutting often end up hurting the business in the long run. \n\nLeading businesses are working to build a more sustainable cost model for the future, in large part by streamlining their IT operations and eliminating inefficiencies. In this article, we’ll explore the hidden risks of cost-cutting and share real-world stories from companies that have created a sustainable cost structure by investing in operational excellence.\n\n#### Cost-cutting is a short-term “solution”\n\nCompanies looking to manage budgets and decrease overall spend commonly turn to cost-cutting. Reducing headcount and freezing strategic investments are ways that an organization can make rapid, clear reductions in spend. \n\nHowever, this approach to streamlining operations may address cashflow issues in the short term at the cost of the long-term health of the business. Some unintended effects of these actions include:\n\n  * **Loss of institutional knowledge:** Employees frequently have knowledge of corporate processes and systems that aren’t recorded in official documentation. A layoff may destroy critical institutional knowledge, putting the company at risk or forcing expensive remediation.\n  * **Reduced operational capacity:** Broad, untargeted layoffs will eliminate employees playing a vital role in the company. With lower headcount and the same overall workload, some tasks will go incomplete.\n  * **Decreased competitiveness:** Freezing strategic investments means that the company isn’t growing or taking advantage of new technology. Competitors who refine their processes or expand their capabilities may take market share as a result.\n  * **Degraded resiliency:** Layoffs and frozen investments both decrease operational resiliency by eliminating key personnel or cancelling vital upgrades. As a result, companies are more at risk of a damaging and expensive incident.\n\nFor many organizations, the ultimate cost of short-term cuts far outweighs their short-term benefits. According to our data, [a minute of downtime costs $4,537](https://www.pagerduty.com/newsroom/study-cost-of-incidents/). That downtime might have been preventable by retaining a vital employee or making a strategic operational investment at a fraction of the cost. Instead of chasing short-term gains, IT leaders should look to reduce long-term spend via strategic investments in operational efficiency and automation.\n\n#### How top companies address key cost drivers\n\nImproved efficiency means doing more with less, not accepting a lower standard of accomplishment. Leading organizations have embraced new technologies and redesigned processes to address the biggest causes of operational inefficiencies in their IT environments.\n\n##### Automating manual processes\n\nManual processes and redundant tasks are a significant contributor to operational inefficiency. On average, engineering teams [waste about 23% of their time](https://www.colabsoftware.com/research/23-of-engineering-time-spent-on-non-value-added-work) on low-value, trivial tasks that could easily be automated or eliminated.\n\nStrategic use of automation, orchestration, and AI can reduce the load on personnel and enable them to focus on writing code and bringing value to the business. For example, using automated scripts to deploy and configure development environments can reduce operational overhead, critical errors, and wasted productivity.\n\n###### Case study: TUI\n\n[TUI](https://www.pagerduty.com/customer/tui/), the world’s largest integrated tourism organization, uses AI operations to reduce time-to-remediation in business-critical contexts, such as booking systems, customer service requests, and payment processes. By using the PagerDuty Operations Cloud to support incident triage and investigations, TUI fixes issues 30% faster on average. For situations involving known scenarios where an auto-remediation script is available, time-to-remediation is reduced by 90%.\n\n##### Enhancing IT integration\n\nAn organization’s overall IT operations function may be broken up into several independent teams, such as operations, development, and security. Poor integration and communication between these teams can impede decision-making and key actions during a security incident, where all of these play a key role.\n\nCompanies can address these potential challenges by developing processes and solutions to bridge the gap between these areas of the business. For example, defining clear processes and automated solutions to route inquiries and requests to the appropriate SME can reduce the time required to address an incident affecting a particular component of an organization’s IT environment.\n\n###### Case study: TD Bank\n\n[TD Bank](https://www.pagerduty.com/in-perspective/accelerating-issue-resolution-aiops/), one of the largest banks in North America, uses PagerDuty AIOps to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of its operations center. When a potential incident is identified, it is automatically routed to the appropriate team while keeping the operations center informed of its current status. By eliminating the middleman, TD Bank has reduced load on its operations center and decreased time-to-response for customer-impacting events by 25%.\n\n##### Preventing potential incidents\n\nSecurity and IT programs often operate with a reactive mindset. Once signs of a potential service outage, cyberattack, or other incident are detected, the team takes action to investigate and remediate the issue. However, this incurs significant costs in terms of downtime and brand reputation as the company and customers wait for normal operations to be restored.\n\nLeveraging automation and agentic AI enables organizations to significantly decrease the incidence, duration, and cost of IT and security incidents. Predictive AI agents can monitor the organization’s environment and detect signs of an impending incident, allowing support personnel to take action before it escalates.\n\n###### Case study: Vodafone\n\n[Vodafone](https://www.pagerduty.com/customer/vodafone/) leverages PagerDuty to identify and prevent potential customer-impacting issues in its infrastructure. Using historical data from past incidents and real-time telemetry, the system detects potential issues in their early stages. By enabling rapid remediation, AI operations reduces the load on support teams, the risk of downtime, and the potential for poor customer experiences.\n\n##### Solution consolidation\n\nComplex IT and security architectures introduce opportunity costs and reduce operational resiliency. As IT environments grow more complex, it is more difficult for support personnel to investigate, understand, and address a potential incident. Additionally, complex infrastructures often mask technical debt, which can negatively impact operational resiliency.\n\nOrganizations that proactively work to streamline their business processes and reduce potential sources of technical debt reduce inefficiency and the risk of potential incidents. Identifying and replacing manual processes with automation for key workloads reduces the time required to complete them, the risk of significant errors, and workload on key personnel. For example, when provisioning cloud-based resources, automated scripts allow systems to be spun up more quickly and ensure that they are appropriately configured.\n\n###### Case study: NYSE\n\nThe [NYSE](https://www.pagerduty.com/customer/nyse/) processes over 750 billion messages each day, and delays in trade completion can negatively impact the customer’s experience and ability to take advantage of opportunities. By using the PagerDuty Operations Cloud to simplify infrastructure monitoring and incident response, the NYSE has been able to enhance operational resiliency and reduce the time taken to process trades by half. This was made possible by ensuring that its personnel had access to the right solutions and could use AI and automation to reduce workloads and focus attention where it was most needed.\n\n#### Reaping the benefits of operational excellence\n\nTechnological advancements, such as the rise of [agentic AI](https://www.pagerduty.com/platform/ai-agents/), have offered new opportunities for companies to enhance operational efficiency. With the ability to intelligently automate various tasks and processes, organizations can focus attention and human personnel where they provide the greatest value to the business. These changes reduce long-term operational expenditures and allow resources to be reallocated to other tasks.\n\nBy refocusing on eliminating sources of operational inefficiency, businesses can also gain a significant competitive advantage in the marketplace. Well-defined, automated processes and comprehensive visibility enable the organization to adapt rapidly to potential issues and opportunities alike.\n\nPagerDuty has over a decade of experience in developing AI systems to solve major business challenges and enhance operational efficiency.

Here’s How to Find Out\n\nby [Joseph Mandros](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/author/jmandros/) May 9, 2025 | 4 min read \n\n[_Take our maturity quiz_](https://www.pagerduty.com/automation-maturity-quiz/) _today and see where your automation maturity stacks up!_\n\n_____________________________________________________________\n\n**Let’s call a spade a spade: Automation isn’t just a “nice to have” anymore.**\n\nAutomation is business-critical for speed, scalability, and resilience. It’s a mechanism of survival in today’s hyper-modern state of business. But the reality is that not every team is on the same page when it comes to automation.\n\nSome departments are stuck in manual mode, relying on tribal knowledge and overburdened experts. Others might have scripts in place but no real strategy. The result? Operational drag, missed SLAs, slow incident response, and rising costs.\n\nThe truth is, automation isn’t a switch you flip—it’s a journey. And the level of _automation maturity_ your organization has reached directly impacts business performance.\n\n#### **The Cost of Immature Automation**\n\nWhen automation is underdeveloped or inconsistently applied, the impact on day-to-day operations is significant. Teams spend valuable time on repetitive tasks, rely on manual processes that slow down resolution, and struggle with fragmented tooling that lacks visibility and control. \n\nWhat starts as a few inefficient workflows can quickly snowball into broader operational issues—missed deadlines, growing ticket queues, and rising frustration across teams. Without a mature automation strategy, organizations end up reacting to problems instead of proactively preventing them.\n\nOrganizations run into all kinds of operational headaches, including:\n\n  * **Manual toil and burnout:** Teams waste time on repetitive tasks, leading to fatigue and slow resolution times.\n  * **Dependency bottlenecks:** Critical workflows depend on a handful of experts to execute scripts or troubleshoot issues.\n  * **Visibility gaps:** Without centralized control, it’s hard to know what’s automated, what isn’t, and where the biggest opportunities lie.\n  * **Security and compliance risks:** Lack of governance opens the door for inconsistencies and errors.\n  * **Innovation gridlock:** Time spent fighting fires is time _not_ spent building the future.\n\nThese challenges compound as teams grow, systems become more complex, and customers expect faster, more reliable service.\n\n#### **Why Automation Maturity Matters**\n\nAutomation maturity isn’t just a buzzword—it’s a strategic indicator of how well your organization is leveraging automation to drive meaningful business outcomes. As you move up the maturity curve, you shift from reactive, manual workflows to proactive, intelligent operations that scale. At the forefront of this evolution are [AI agents](https://www.pagerduty.com/platform/ai-agents/)—autonomous, goal-driven systems that can handle repetitive tasks, orchestrate complex response actions, and adapt in real time. \n\nBy embedding AI agents into your operations, you not only accelerate resolution times and reduce manual toil, but also free up teams to focus on higher-value work. This level of automation maturity enables greater agility, operational efficiency, and a more resilient business overall. To learn more about PagerDuty’s AI agents, sign up for early access [here](https://www.pagerduty.com/early-access/).\n\nIn PagerDuty’s Automation Maturity Model, we outline five key stages:\n\n  1. **Manual** – Everything is done by hand. Automation is either nonexistent or limited to one-off scripts.\n  2. **Siloed** – Automation exists, but it’s trapped within teams or only accessible to experts.\n  3. **Centralized** – Automation is standardized and governed, with self-service access across the organization.\n  4. **Standardized** – A scalable framework emerges, balancing structure and flexibility.\n  5. **Adaptive** – Automation becomes intelligent, dynamic, and AI-driven, operating behind the scenes to prevent issues before they impact users.\n\nAs you progress through the maturity model, you unlock a host of operational and business benefits that stem from individual contributors up to executive-level business value:\n\n  * **Reduced Costs & Manual Effort. **With mature automation, teams spend less time on repetitive work and more time on innovation. That translates to lower operational costs and a higher return on talent.\n  * **Faster Incident Resolution.** Empowered teams can trigger automation on-demand, dramatically reducing Mean Time to Resolution (MTTR) and minimizing customer impact.\n  * **Improved Governance & Control. **A centralized Automation Center of Excellence ensures that automation follows best practices, stays secure, and aligns with business objectives.\n  * **Scalability & Innovation. **By reducing friction and enabling self-service, automation becomes a true force multiplier—helping organizations scale faster and adapt to change.\n  * **AI-Driven Agility.** At the highest level, automation isn’t just triggered by users—it’s driven by real-time events and augmented by AI to execute, recommend, and even design automated responses.\n\n#### **Unlock Your Full Automation Potential**\n\nWhether you’re just starting your automation journey or well on your way to AI-executed operations, understanding your current level of automation maturity is key to leveling up.\n\nFind out what stage of maturity your organization is at by [taking our maturity assessment](https://www.pagerduty.com/automation-maturity-quiz/). \n\nOnce you’ve figured out which stage you’re at, take a look at the [Automation Maturity ebook](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/automation/ebook/guide-to-automation-maturity/) to learn more about your stage, what it means for your team, and what you can do to advance to the next stage of maturity. \n\nWant to skip the formalities?

A single service outage or poor customer experience can severely damage both revenue and brand reputation. When customers or businesses encounter obstacles with their preferred vendor, they often turn to competitors – and these temporary shifts frequently become permanent changes in loyalty.\n\nThis reality has elevated operational resilience to a top priority in C-suites and boardrooms worldwide. As the saying goes, trust is lost in buckets but gained only in drops, making robust operational resilience more crucial than ever.\n\nBut what does operational resilience truly mean in practice, and why has it become such a pressing concern for enterprises?\n\n**Our interconnected nature magnifies issues**\n\nThe global IT outage of July 19 last year exemplifies how the interconnected nature of modern enterprises can amplify the impact of technical failures.\n\nLooking back at history, similar incidents involving [corrupt files](https://www.zdnet.com/article/defective-mcafee-update-causes-worldwide-meltdown-of-xp-pcs/) have occurred before. However, there’s a crucial difference: digital infrastructure wasn’t nearly as interconnected then as it is today, which meant the ripple effects were far more contained.\n\nThese recent major outages serve as a stark reminder of why resilience is critical and why swift problem identification and resolution are essential. Every second counts – not just in terms of immediate financial impact, but also in managing operational costs and protecting brand reputation. This has become even more crucial as technology stacks have grown increasingly complex since last July, with organizations now incorporating AI agents and Large Language Models (LLMs).\n\nOne thing remains certain: while digital incidents have always carried significant consequences, they will continue to occur – whether tomorrow, next week, or next year. The question isn’t if, but when.\n\n**Defining operational resilience**\n\nBuilding operational resilience is crucial in combating system incidents, but it requires more than just technological solutions – it demands fostering a culture of resilience throughout the organization.\n\nWhile companies invest substantially in monitoring technologies and incident response systems, these tools alone cannot prevent all outages. True operational resilience emerges from the combination of three key elements: rigorous processes, a proactive mindset, and an unwavering commitment to continuous improvement.\n\nOrganizations that excel in operational resilience acknowledge a fundamental truth: even the most comprehensive monitoring systems won’t catch every problem. In fact, customers often detect issues before internal operations teams do. This reality underscores the importance of developing robust signal-capture mechanisms across all channels. For instance, organizations must establish clear pathways for customer service teams to escalate client-reported issues directly to ITOps or DevOps teams.\n\nThe bottom line? While having the right technology is important, it’s the human element that makes the difference. Success in operational resilience hinges on developing processes and cultivating a culture that empowers teams to swiftly identify and effectively address issues – regardless of whether they’re detected by machines or people.\n\n**Building a culture of continuous learning**\n\nEven with sophisticated monitoring systems and well-designed processes, unexpected issues inevitably arise. Whether it’s a hardware failure, a code change affecting specific customers, or a missed alert signal, these scenarios remind us that true resilience depends on our ability to learn, adapt, and prepare for the unexpected.\n\nA resilient organizational culture must prioritize continuous learning. While most teams have the necessary tools to learn from incidents, the key challenge lies in effectively tapping into subject matter experts’ knowledge. These insights must be systematically captured and shared to strengthen processes and foster team-wide growth.\n\nCurrently, many organizations rely on a small group of experts who routinely handle incident remediation. These specialists instinctively know what actions to take and whom to involve. However, when these experts find themselves repeatedly addressing similar incidents, it signals a gap in the organization’s ability to translate incident learnings into lasting improvements.\n\nBuilding true resilience requires breaking this cycle. Expert knowledge must be democratized to enable faster, more efficient problem-solving across the organization. This means:\n\n  * Understanding each incident’s full context and impact\n  * Assessing how processes and systems can be enhanced to prevent recurrence\n  * Identifying opportunities for automation to reduce dependency on expert intervention\n\nAt PagerDuty, we view every incident as a learning opportunity – a chance to refine response strategies, minimize recurrence risks, and evolve our operational processes. For more detailed guidance on this approach, we invite you to explore our [Post-Incident HOWIE guide](https://howie-guide.pagerduty.com/).\n\n**The role of AI and automation**\n\nAI and automation will play a central role in creating reliable experiences and facilitating organizational learning. The industry recognizes this shift: a striking 86% of ITOps and DevOps leaders report their organizations are progressing toward fully automated [incident response processes](https://www.pagerduty.com/newsroom/study-cost-of-incidents/). A further 51% say they have [already deployed AI agents](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/ai/learn/companies-expecting-agentic-ai-roi-2025/), with another 35% planning to deploy them within the next two years.\n\nWhile digital incidents will inevitably increase in frequency, duration, and cost, organizations aren’t powerless against this trend. The path to strong operational resilience lies in combining three key elements:\n\n  * Robust processes that adapt to changing conditions\n  * A culture of continuous learning and improvement\n  * Strategic adoption of AI and automation technologies\n\nWhen these elements work in harmony, organizations can create the reliable experiences that build, maintain, and strengthen customer trust in an increasingly digital world.\n\n[ automation  ](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/tag/automation/) [ Best Practices  ](https://www.pagerduty.com/blog/tag/best-practices/) [ digital operations

As I looked around the packed room, filled with industry peers and valued customers, I was reminded why now more than ever, modern operations isn’t a “nice to have” but a strategic imperative.\n\n#### **A Day of Bold Insights and Meaningful Connections**\n\nThe London agenda was as dynamic as it gets. We kicked things off with a welcome that set the tone: a celebration of our journey from the early days—when digital operations was a mere concept—to an era where AI and automation are redefining how enterprises tackle critical, real-time work. Our story—which spans over a decade of pioneering digital operations—was set against the backdrop of today’s urgent challenges. The discussions were refreshingly candid, with speakers celebrating “failure-ready” cultures and the notion that incidents, when treated as learning opportunities, become a catalyst for continuous innovation.\n\nIn one memorable fireside chat, Nora Jones sat down with Andy White, Director of Technology Operations at Checkout.com, whose stories of shifting from chaotic, overpopulated Slack channels to a lean, automated incident workflow were both eye-opening and energizing. His candid account of the evolution at Checkout.com—from manually paging employees to leveraging full-stack automation and even AI-driven diagnostics—offered a tangible blueprint for other organizations transitioning from legacy to modern operations. What struck me was his honesty about the challenges of removing “the human from that loop” and yet embracing that change to scale operational resiliency.\n\nWe also explored the disruptive side of outages. Industry experts, Laura Morgan from Spotify and Julia Weimer from Wiz drove home the message: operational resilience underpins customer trust. With [91% of UK IT and business execs convinced that major incidents are a matter of “when” rather than “if,”](https://www.pagerduty.com/state-of-digital-ops/) the imperative to build a system that anticipates failure—and learns from it—is clearer than ever. This message carries particular weight given that outage costs have risen to an average of $850,000 per hour. As a trusted partner to two-thirds of Fortune 100 companies and over 6,000 EMEA organizations, we understand the critical nature of this challenge and the importance of getting it right.\n\nElizabeth Nguli, Head of Global Cloud Engineering at Vodafone, shared how embedding AI-driven diagnostics into incident workflows isn’t just tech for tech’s sake—it’s about reducing response times and taking the manual toil off the shoulders of on-call teams. And she’s not alone. In fact, the numbers are clear: [88% of IT leaders are already planning to integrate AI agents into their operations in the next couple of years](https://www.pagerduty.com/state-of-digital-ops/).\n\nLastly, Andy Slater from Specsavers candidly talked about empowering teams with self-service tools to erase manual toil and let people focus on innovation. This session felt like a nudge to all leaders: you have the tools; now grab them and start transforming your day-to-day operations.\n\nOur hands-on tech workshops on operational excellence, automation standardization, and incident management were a standout, giving attendees practical tools and insights to accelerate their digital transformation journeys.\n\n#### **Championing an AI-First Approach**\n\nJeff Hausman, our Chief Product Development Officer, delivered a keynote that perfectly encapsulated our vision: that the future of operations lies in the seamless integration of human expertise with AI and automation. From real-world examples of how our customers are transforming their operational strategies, to the evolution of our newly introduced AI agents, the message was unmistakable—winner organizations are not just adopting new technologies; they’re embedding them into the very fabric of their operational DNA. And CIOs are leading the charge in recognizing Agentic AI as a crucial capability. It’s time for practitioners to catch up to this vision and embrace the transformative potential of AI in operations.\n\nI was particularly inspired by the vision of a modern operations lifecycle where every phase—predictive alerts, rapid diagnostics, and even post-incident reviews—is enhanced by intelligent, automated workflows. It was a day that underscored our commitment to not merely keeping pace with technological change, but leading the conversation as an operations cloud that connects people, processes, and technology.\n\n#### **A Call to Action for the Future**\n\nWhat resonated with me most from these sessions was a reaffirmed belief: Operations is not a cost center. It is a competitive advantage. Our partners and customers have seen firsthand the results—a potential reduction of incident response times, decreased noise from unnecessary alerts, and ultimately, the preservation of customer trust. The energy in the room affirmed that when you combine deep operational knowledge with an AI-first mindset, the potential is not just incremental improvement—it’s transformational.\n\nAs we move forward, I encourage every leader in digital operations to take that first step. Start small, test, iterate, and most importantly, learn from every misstep. Embrace the change because innovation, after all, is a journey where failure is simply a stepping stone toward success. Let’s continue to be partners—learning, growing, and pushing the boundaries of what modern operations can achieve.\n\nI’m incredibly proud to be a part of this journey and excited for the conversations we’ll continue to have in the future. Thank you to everyone who made PagerDuty on Tour London a tremendous success.

Over 180 attendees squeezed into the SRE track alone, a testament to the demand for hands-on, practical learning. These workshops weren’t about theory — they were about building tangible skills in automation, runbook orchestration, event-driven workflows, and noise reduction, all powered by PagerDuty Operations Cloud.\n\n**Executive Roundtable Brunch and Partner Breakfast: Real conversations on resilience**\n\nWhile the workshops were in full swing, a select group of executives gathered for an exclusive, closed-door Executive Roundtable, while partners joined a separate Partner Breakfast.\n\nThe Executive Roundtable discussion began by touching on key topics from the _“ Ahead of_ _the Curve ”_ white paper, which PagerDuty co-sponsored with the AFR.  \nBut very quickly, the conversation became fluid, passionate, and honest, moving beyond frameworks into the practical realities leaders are grappling with today.\n\nWhile we will not reveal specific topics out of respect for the room, some strong themes stood out:\n\n  * Resilience has now firmly taken its place in the boardroom. What was once viewed as an IT issue is now recognised as a critical leadership and reputational priority, with directors and executives directly accountable, particularly under new regulations such as APRA’s CPS230 in Financial Services.\n  * Leaders agreed that real-world impact matters more than rigid severity labels; prioritisation must be driven by business context, not technical definitions.\n  * Credibility, once lost, is hard to rebuild, and reducing noise and false alarms through smarter alerting is now essential for maintaining trust within teams.\n  * Customer stories, not technical metrics, are proving to be the most powerful tools for building internal urgency and securing investment.\n  * Automation was a significant focus: manual recovery is simply too slow in today’s environment. Communication is also becoming a differentiator, with the growing need for clear, audience-specific summaries tailored to executives, engineers, and frontline teams.\n  * Resilience culture itself is evolving, with scenario testing and simulations expanding beyond IT into the wider business.\n  * And looking ahead, there was intense excitement around how AI and agentic tooling could be practically co-designed to assist teams during and after incidents, not as futuristic concepts, but as real, operational supports.\n\nIt was one of the most energetic and honest conversations of the day — a clear reminder that resilience today is about leadership, trust, and readiness, not just systems and processes.\n\nDue to the overwhelmingly positive feedback, we will be hosting a follow-up Executive Roundtable later this year to revisit the key themes from this discussion — to see what’s changed, what progress has been made, explore new challenges that have emerged, and continue growing as a connected leadership group focused on resilience and operational excellence.\n\nIn parallel with the Executive Roundtable, we hosted a Partner Breakfast to connect with a few of our key regional partners. It provided a valuable opportunity for more personal conversations on go-to-market alignment, regional trends, and how we can continue to strengthen collaboration in the ANZ region.\n\n##### **The main event: Vision, execution, and customer excellence**\n\n**A**[**fireside chat**](https://www.pagerduty.com/on-tour/on-demand/)**with PEXA and Car Group: Building operational resilience from the top**\n\nPagerDuty CMO Katherine Calvert opened the main event with an extraordinary fireside conversation, bringing together two of Australia’s leading technology executives:\n\n  * Eglantine Etiemble, Group CTO at PEXA,\n\n  * Jason Blackman, CIO at Car Group​.\n\nTogether, they unpacked what operational resilience truly entails at the boardroom table — and why it has become a strategic priority, not just an IT goal.\n\nPEXA, responsible for over 90% of Australia’s property transactions, shared how maintaining nearly 100% platform availability is critical not only to their customers but to national financial stability.  \nWith PagerDuty AIOps, PEXA has dramatically reduced Mean Time To Resolution (MTTR) from 36 to 13 minutes, cut incident noise by 45%, and improved team health by eliminating overnight disruptions — all while saving the ecosystem over $290 million AUD in annual productivity gains.\n\nMeanwhile, Car Group, which operates marketplaces and SaaS platforms across ANZ and the Americas, shared how it re-architected its operations to avoid single points of failure globally, prioritising localised deployments to safeguard user experience, and driving a cultural transformation where developers and product owners fully own operational resilience.  \nJason Blackman also spoke to how customer-centric incident prioritisation — focusing on peak user impact, not just technical severity — is critical to building trust at scale.\n\nThroughout the session, a core theme emerged:  \nOperational resilience today is boardroom business — an enabler of growth, trust, and brand strength.\n\nThis was not a technical session — it was a masterclass in what it takes to lead operational excellence in 2025 and beyond.\n\n**Product keynote:****  \n** Chief Product Development Officer Jeff Hausman and SVP Product Development David Williams outlined how PagerDuty is [redefining the future](https://www.pagerduty.com/on-tour/on-demand/)​:\n\n  * **Agentic AI vision:** Empowering autonomous AI agents to resolve multi-step, cross-tool incidents.\n\n  * **Embedded Incident Management:** Now fully integrated into Microsoft Teams and Slack.\n\n  * **Security innovation:** New automation workflows and expanded observability partnerships with leaders like Arize.\n\nThe future isn’t incremental change — it’s a **complete operational transformation**.\n\n**Customer stories: Transformation in action**\n\n****Throughout the afternoon, leaders from across industries shared their hard-earned lessons from the frontlines of operational resilience:\n\n  * Elzanne van der Westhuizen from [Coles ](https://www.pagerduty.com/on-tour/on-demand/)revealed how they **reduced false-positive incident noise by 85%** , freeing their engineering teams to focus on innovation.\n\n  * Niall McCarthy from [Block](https://www.pagerduty.com/on-tour/on-demand/) (Afterpay, Cash App) discussed scaling global incident management frameworks to support seamless customer experiences and the power of a common language in communicating between technical and business stakeholders. [Accenture](https://www.pagerduty.com/on-tour/on-demand/)’s Francesco Sbaraglia outlined how modern SRE practices and chaos engineering principles are changing resilience strategies for global enterprises​.\n\n  * [One NZ’s](https://www.pagerduty.com/on-tour/on-demand/) Chris Gadd shared how automation is transforming service operations, reducing toil, and increasing operational agility. A standout example was their ability to reduce the time to detect and block spam SMS from **30 minutes to under one** **minute** — a significant operational impact, as millions of spam messages could otherwise be sent within that timeframe.​\n\nThese weren’t high-level case studies — these were real playbooks, forged through experience and designed for action.\n\n**Beyond the sessions: Building resilient communities**\n\nAt PagerDuty, operational excellence should be taken seriously, but the experience should be joyful.\n\nAcross the venue, attendees enjoyed:\n\n  * **A vibrant Activation Zone** , complete with a donut wall, fresh popcorn, a yoghurt bar, tech booths, and even a claw machine packed with prizes\n\n  * **The Incident Commander game** , where attendees tested their ability to lead through simulated chaos\n\n  * [**PagerDuty University signups**](https://university.pagerduty.com/) , extending learning, and getting certified beyond the event\n\nFun prizes and challenges kept the energy high all day.\n\n**Celebrity host: Mentalist Phoenix**\n\n****Guiding the day ’s pace and energy, we were thrilled to have Mentalist Phoenix as our celebrity host.\n\nPhoenix brought magic — literally — with mentalist sessions during networking breaks and between talks, keeping the audience buzzing with energy and amazement.\n\n**A closing reminder of grit: Ariarne Titmus**\n\nAs a final moment of inspiration, Olympic champion Ariarne Titmus took the stage​.  \nHer [story](https://www.pagerduty.com/on-tour/on-demand/) — of perseverance, strategic focus, and overcoming unseen challenges — reflected exactly what operational excellence demands:  \nResilience isn’t reactive. It’s built through years of unseen work.\n\n##### **Exclusive evening: Executive dinner at Theatre Royale, Hubert’s**\n\nThe day culminated in a private Executive Dinner at the stunning Theatre Royale at Hubert’s, an exclusive evening designed to deepen connections in a relaxed, vibrant setting.\n\nThe highlight of the evening was Australian Olympic gold medallist Steven Bradbury, who shared stories of resilience, luck, and preparation meeting opportunities — a fitting mirror to the day’s core theme.\n\nGuests enjoyed spirited discussions, card games, and plenty of laughter throughout the night.\n\nAt the end of the evening, winnings from the games — a total of **$2,000** — were donated to **Mission Australia** , a reminder that leadership isn’t just about performance, it’s also about community, impact, and giving back.\n\nIt wasn’t simply a dinner.  \nIt was a celebration of community, resilience, and giving back.\n\n##### **PagerDuty On Tour Sydney 2025: Building Resilient Leaders for Tomorrow**\n\nAttendees left not just with new knowledge, but a renewed drive to transform.\n\nThey walked away:\n\n  * **Knowing** : PagerDuty is the trusted partner for building modern, AI-powered operations.\n\n  * **Feeling** : Empowered, connected, and inspired.\n\n  * **Ready to** : Lead change, build resilience, and seize new opportunities in their organisations.\n\n##### **Thank You, Sydney**\n\nTo everyone who made PagerDuty On Tour Sydney 2025 a success, thank you.  \nYour passion, energy, and ambition fuel what’s next.\n\nTogether, we’re not just managing incidents. We’re building the future of operational resilience.\n\nWe’re already looking ahead to next year, with plans for even more advanced workshops, an even stronger speaker lineup, and new ways to push the boundaries of what’s possible.  \nKeep an eye out for our **Expression of Interest emails** — we’d love to see even more of our community involved in shaping what comes next.\n\nThe journey is just beginning — and we’re excited to keep building it together.\n\n[ X

While collecting this data is straightforward, extracting meaningful insights that drive business value is anything but. This is where modern AIOps makes all the difference – and where PagerDuty stands apart. [PagerDuty AIOps](https://www.pagerduty.com/platform/aiops/) doesn’t contribute to tool sprawl and data overload, it tames it.\n\n**Beyond the AI Hype**\n\nLet’s be clear: while AI dominates today’s tech conversations, AIOps isn’t just another buzzword. Despite becoming a charged term that varies from vendor to vendor and from organization to organization, it’s a practical solution to real operational challenges. Whether you’ve known it as event management, event correlation, or event intelligence, the core need remains constant: separate the signal from the noise by turning overwhelming data into the next best action. Let’s define the core elements of AIOps solutions to improve your operational resilience and reclaim time for higher-value work.\n\n**What Are the Essential Elements of AIOps?**\n\nThere’s no one-size-fits-all approach to AIOps. Every organization has different systems, priorities, and levels of maturity. Observability vendors may offer it as an add-on for their bespoke tooling, while platform vendors provide a more holistic approach centered around the way you work. At its core, AIOps is about assembling the right capabilities to help your teams manage complexity, act faster, and deliver real business value, today and into the future. Key elements of AIOps include:\n\n  1. **Separating Signal from the Noise:** Modern environments generate a flood of alerts, but not all are created equal. AIOps platforms must intelligently filter out the noise, surfacing only the most relevant signals so teams can focus on what matters.\n  2. **Event Correlation and Enrichment:** It’s not enough to know that something happened; you need to understand the context. By correlating related events and enriching them with additional data, AIOps helps teams quickly pinpoint root causes and reduce time-to-resolution.\n  3. **Incident Visibility:** True AIOps provides a unified view across the entire incident lifecycle, giving both central IT and DevOps teams the visibility they need to collaborate and resolve issues faster.\n  4. **Multi-Telemetry Ingestion:** Today’s IT environments are heterogeneous. AIOps must ingest and analyze data from a wide range of sources—cloud, on-prem, applications, infrastructure, and more—without being locked into a single observability vendor.\n  5. **Intelligent processing and recommendations** : Information should be surfaced when prompted by GenAI or, even better, autonomously collected and shared by agentic AI.\n\n**Tackle Operational Challenges with PagerDuty’s Platform-First Approach**\n\nPagerDuty AIOps drives results faster with a differentiated, platform-first approach that automates toil, reduces noise, and accelerates triage. It starts with ingestion: consolidating data, events, and signals from across observability tools and telemetry sources out of the box. This means you don’t need to re-architect your business so that all of your data flows into a single tool with strict data integrity standards. You can pull in data from wherever it lives—across clouds, monitoring tools, and custom sources—enabling a holistic, vendor-agnostic view of your operations. \n\nFrom there, PagerDuty’s AIOps is built to fit seamlessly into existing processes, driving to next best action and getting to the fix as soon as possible. PagerDuty automates whatever’s possible to deflect unnecessary noise and work from resource-strapped teams, returning valuable time to build and innovate faster. Where automation can’t resolve issues on its own, PagerDuty accelerates triage with actionable insight to build situational awareness throughout the incident lifecycle. A key characteristic that sets PagerDuty apart is how it’s built to help both central IT/network operations center and distributed developer teams reap the benefits of AIOps so they can work smarter, not harder. \n\n**Preventing Incidents Saves Time for Innovation**\n\nPagerDuty AIOps serves as a powerful hub, enabling you to build automations, conduct incident response, and orchestrate resources to maximize efficiency for your business. PagerDuty’s AI-first approach to operations helps organizations move faster, work smarter, and make better decisions by tackling 3 archetypes of critical operations work:\n\n  * **Well-understood incidents** have clear causes and solutions – we know exactly what triggered them and how to fix them. These incidents are prime candidates for automation and AI to resolve autonomously since both the diagnosis and remediation are straightforward.\n  * **Partially understood incidents** have multiple possible causes, each with known solutions. The challenge here is quickly identifying the correct root cause to apply the right fix. Human discretion is required to set AI on the right path towards remediation. But make no mistake: for these incidents, AI and automation take the lead, bringing humans in only when necessary and with the right information to make decisions.\n  * **New/novel and major incidents** lack both defined causes and solutions, requiring teams to simultaneously diagnose and develop fixes. Here, humans run the show. AI and automation serve as trusty assistants that let humans do the complex reasoning we excel at.\n\nAcross all types of incidents, AI and automation serve a purpose and a function to help reduce costs and correlate signals across a complex environment. This powerful combination of automation and intelligence not only accelerates incident resolution, but also enables organizations to scale their operational capabilities. \n\n**Three PagerDuty AIOps Capabilities Worth Their Weight In Gold**\n\nAt PagerDuty, we believe AIOps should empower teams, not constrain them. That’s why our roadmap has been focused on leading the charge on serving both central IT/NOC and distributed teams to accelerate velocity, helping teams do more with less. Here are a few innovations that have helped transform our customers’ operations: \n\n  1. **Operations Console** : Provides operations teams with a single pane of glass for visualizing and responding to time-critical incidents. Customize and share filters, collaborate as a team, and take action on incidents.\n  2. **Alert Grouping** : Reduce the noise instantly by grouping alerts across one or more services using built-in machine learning, your own logic, or both for precise correlation control\n  3. **Event Orchestration** : Enrich events, control their routing, and trigger self-healing actions based on event data. Teams can use this functionality across any or all services within PagerDuty.\n\nPagerDuty customer Luke Rotta from Chicago Trading company shared, “Before PagerDuty, we sometimes had 50-200 alerts coming in at once. … That number is now down to 5-10.”\n\nIn fact, Forrester’s study on [The Total Economic ImpactTM Of The PagerDuty Operations Cloud](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/operations-cloud/analyst-report/unlock-the-roi-of-pagerduty-forrester-study/) found that PagerDuty customers realized a 249% ROI over three years, achieved a 91% reduction in alert noise, helping teams prioritize critical incidents, and saw a 59% reduction in downtime, leading to improved productivity and reduced costs.* \n\n**PagerDuty is a Leader in AIOps**\n\nIn recognition of our approach, PagerDuty was named a Leader and Outperformer for the third consecutive year in the [GigaOm Radar for AIOps, 2024](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/aiops/analyst-report/gigaom-radar-for-aiops-2024/) report. GigaOm analyst Dr. Shane Archiquette said, “With its well-respected collaboration and workflow abilities, the solution presents a strong case for large organizations with entrenched monitoring and observability tooling to gain an AI-assisted view of the enterprise.”\n\nThis flexibility is critical for modern enterprises, where different teams may use different tools, and where agility is key. PagerDuty’s platform ingests, correlates, and enriches data from across the most complex ecosystems, ensuring that both central IT and DevOps teams have the insights they need, when they need them.\n\nAdditionally, Forrester named PagerDuty a Leader in [The Forrester Wave™: Process-Centric AI For IT Operations (AIOps), Q2 2023](https://www.pagerduty.com/resources/aiops/reports/forrester-process-centric-aiops-wave-2023-report/), citing our ability to deliver actionable insights and drive operational excellence.\n\n**Pioneering the Future: Where Human Expertise Meets AI-Powered Operations**\n\nAs the AIOps landscape evolves, PagerDuty sets the standard, enabling organizations to transition from reactive firefighting to proactive, data-driven operations. By augmenting human expertise with AI-driven automation and insights, organizations can achieve unparalleled levels of operational efficiency, improve service reliability, and maintain competitive advantage in an increasingly complex digital landscape – all while ensuring their most valuable technical resources remain focused on innovation and business-critical initiatives. \n\n**Ready to see
