This Perimeter is rather large, with a 15,000+ Projects within Enforced, and these same 15,000+ projects are also in Dry Run. The management of projects within the Perimeter is handled by a separate API, and not the above resource. \r\n\r\nWe also have 40+ Ingress Policies within both enforced and dry run, in addition to 40+ Egress Policies within both as well. Each Ingress/Egress Policy contains a varying number of Identities and Resources coming out to a total of 2,500+ Ingress/Egress Attributes. \r\n\r\nWith the scale in mind, below is just a small portion of the Terraform Module.\r\n\r\n```tf\r\n### main.tf file\r\nmodule \"vpcsc\" {\r\n  source = \"xxx\"\r\n  org_id                                      = var.org_id\r\n  access_policy_id                            = var.access_policy_id\r\n  vpcsc_perimeters                            = var.vpcsc_perimeters\r\n  vpcsc_access_levels                         = var.vpcsc_access_levels\r\n  create_access_context_manager_access_policy = var.create_access_context_manager_access_policy\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```tf\r\n### terraform.tfvars file\r\norg_id = \"11223344\"\r\naccess_levels = {}\r\nvpcsc_perimeters = {\r\n  \"prod_vpcsc_perimeter\" = {\r\n    description    = \"Org Service Perimeter\"\r\n    access_levels  = []\r\n    ingress_policies = [\r\n      {\r\n        from = {\r\n          identities = [\r\n            \"serviceAccount:xxx@xxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com\",\r\n          ]\r\n          sources = {\r\n            access_levels = [\"*\"]\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        to = {\r\n          resources = [\r\n            \"projects/xxx\",\r\n          ]\r\n          operations = [{\r\n            service_name = \"storage.googleapis.com\"\r\n            method_selectors = [{\r\n              method = \"*\"\r\n            }]\r\n          }]\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      # List Continues with 40+ Ingress Policies defiend with varying numbers of identities and resources\r\n    ]\r\n    egress_policies = [\r\n      {\r\n        from = {\r\n          identity_type = \"ANY_IDENTITY\"\r\n        }\r\n        to = {\r\n          resources = [\r\n            \"projects/xxxx\",\r\n            \"projects/yyyy\",\r\n          ]\r\n          operations = [\r\n            {\r\n              service_name     = \"artifactregistry.googleapis.com\"\r\n              method_selectors = [{ method = \"*\" }]\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              service_name     = \"storage.googleapis.com\"\r\n              method_selectors = [{ method = \"*\" }]\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      # List continues with 40+ Egress Policies Defined with varying numbers of identities and resources\r\n    ]\r\n    ingress_policies_dry_run = [\r\n      {\r\n        from = {\r\n          identities = [\r\n            \"serviceAccount:xxx@xxx.iam.gserviceaccount.com\",\r\n          ]\r\n          sources = {\r\n            access_levels = [\"*\"]\r\n          }\r\n        }\r\n        to = {\r\n          resources = [\r\n            \"projects/xxx\",\r\n          ]\r\n          operations = [{\r\n            service_name = \"storage.googleapis.com\"\r\n            method_selectors = [{\r\n              method = \"*\"\r\n            }]\r\n          }]\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      # List Continues with 40+ Ingress Policies defiend with varying numbers of identities and resources\r\n    ]\r\n    egress_policies_dry_run = [\r\n      {\r\n        from = {\r\n          identity_type = \"ANY_IDENTITY\"\r\n        }\r\n        to = {\r\n          resources = [\r\n            \"projects/xxxx\",\r\n            \"projects/yyyy\",\r\n          ]\r\n          operations = [\r\n            {\r\n              service_name     = \"artifactregistry.googleapis.com\"\r\n              method_selectors = [{ method = \"*\" }]\r\n            },\r\n            {\r\n              service_name     = \"storage.googleapis.com\"\r\n              method_selectors = [{ method = \"*\" }]\r\n            }\r\n          ]\r\n        }\r\n      },\r\n      # List continues with 40+ Egress Policies Defined with varying numbers of identities and resources\r\n    ]\r\n  }\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Debug Output\r\n\r\nBelow was a test with provider v5.40.0, however the same results take place for v5.44.0 as well.

This includes the \"Refreshing State\" step for the Service Perimeter resource, which appears to be the step which it's runtime has increased substantially. When bumping the provider version up to `v5.X`, we expected the runtime to remain somewhat consistent and remain in that 10-20 second range or at least below 1 minute. However, instead when it attempts to refresh it's state, it's gone from 10-20 seconds all the way up to 10 to 20 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Behavior\r\n\r\nWhen using Provider `v5.X` for the Access Context Manager Service Perimeter Resource, our Terraform Plan and Apply both have had their runtimes absolutely skyrocket. Particularly during the \"Refreshing State\" Step for the Service Perimeter Resource. Where it went from that 10-20 seconds to taking 10 to 20 minutes just to refresh the state.\r\n\r\nInvestigating if any sort of quota limits are being hit, that doesn't appear to the case, and the /GET request to fetch the service perimeter still only takes place once just like it did with provider v4.X.\r\n\r\n### Potential Reason for Performance Issues\r\n\r\nWith the bump to `v5.x` for the terraform-provider-google, the `google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter` resource has switched from using TypeList to using TypeSet for the majority of lists defined in the resource. Reference: [5.0.0 Upgrade Guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/version_5_upgrade#resource-google_access_context_manager_service_perimeters-and-google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter)\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can also find the code updates within this [commit](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/commit/3e00cfbafa1ef13ebfd7e039bcec77407b824bfc).\r\n\r\nSo for every single one of our lists within an Ingress Policies, Egress Policy, in addition to resources within the perimeter, each time the flatten and expand function takes place for each of these variables.\r\n\r\n#### Provider v4.X of Expand & Flatten Functions\r\n```\r\nfunc expandAccessContextManagerServicePerimeterSpecResources(v interface{}, d tpgresource.TerraformResourceData, config *transport_tpg.Config) (interface{}, error) {\r\n\treturn v, nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nfunc flattenAccessContextManagerServicePerimeterSpecResources(v interface{}, d *schema.ResourceData, config *transport_tpg.Config) interface{} {\r\n\treturn v\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Provider v5.X Expand and Flatten Functions\r\n```\r\nfunc expandAccessContextManagerServicePerimeterSpecResources(v interface{}, d tpgresource.TerraformResourceData, config *transport_tpg.Config) (interface{}, error) {\r\n\tv = v.(*schema.Set).List()\r\n\treturn v, nil\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```\r\nfunc flattenAccessContextManagerServicePerimeterSpecResources(v interface{}, d *schema.ResourceData, config *transport_tpg.Config) interface{} {\r\n\tif v == nil {\r\n\t\treturn v\r\n\t}\r\n\treturn schema.NewSet(schema.HashString, v.([]interface{}))\r\n}\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo now take into account that our Service Perimeter resource has 15,000+ Resources within SpecResources, and then another 15,000+ resources within StatusResources. And each time these flatten and expand functions are being called where they're either converting to a Set with hashstrings, or taking the set and returning a list. Whereas before they always just dealt with lists where no hashing was taking place. Now add that this change to using Sets and hashstrings took place to each of the resources below, and I believe this is what is causing the substantial time increase. Where that time increase has caused the provider `v5.X` to be unusable.\r\n\r\nThis is making it so we can not take advantage of new feature releases for the VPC-SC Service such as defining Source -> Access Levels within an Egress Policy. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n1. `tf init -input=false`\r\n2. `tf plan -input=false`\r\n3. `tf apply -input=false --auto-approve`\r\n\r\nThe difficult part for others to reproduce this is the size of the service perimeter that we're dealing with. Such as the 15,000+ Projects. \r\n\r\nAlso, the performance decrease is taking place during the \"Refreshing State\" step for the Service Perimeter resource. So an existing perimeter needs to already be created.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Important Factoids\r\n\r\n- The reason I believe it's the size of the Perimeter resource is because I upgrade the provider from v4.x to v5.x in a separate environment with no issues. However, that Perimeter only contains 45 projects and just a few ingress/egress policies whereas the one facing performance issues contains 15,000+ projects and quite a few more ingress/egress policies.\r\n\r\n- Keep in mind, it's the refreshing state step during the dag/walk which is taking the substantial amount of time. Simply running Terraform Plan with inputs won't replicate this. It's only occurring when there is a resource which already exists which contains a large number of attributes. Where the provider has to update the existing state. \r\n\r\n- For the Perimeter facing the performance issues, it's still able to run a terraform plan and apply successfully. It's just the case where even after the plan and apply were completed, every subsequent run after also face the same performance issues making it so that to make one minor change to an Ingress Policy for example, takes upwards of an hour via our pipeline.\r\n\r\n- If possible we'd like to avoid having to migrate everything to the new resources which have been created, and continue to utilize the service_perimeter resource for managing the majority of our perimeters configuration. This is because VPC-SC is a service that can affect an entire environment and the risk of outages within an environment are rather high when making major changes to the resource.\r\n\r\n- [VPC-SC Quota Limits](https://cloud.google.com/vpc-service-controls/quotas#access-policy-limits): If it is the case where the use of TypeSet and the use of hashes is causing this major difference in performance, then it constrains the `resource_access_context_manager_service_perimeter` greatly in terms of what it is capable of compared to what Google allows for the service. For example, the Default Quota Limit allows for up to 40k projects defined in a service perimeter. If a user goes with the `single unified perimeter` approach which is recommended by Google, then this Terraform Resource becomes almost unusable just based off it's performance issues where it can take upwards of 45 minutes to an hour for changes to be made to the perimeter. Where with 4.X, that change would only take a couple of minutes to run through all of the pipeline steps.\r\n\r\n### References\r\n\r\n- [V5.X Upgrade Guide](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/google/latest/docs/guides/version_5_upgrade#resource-google_access_context_manager_service_perimeters-and-google_access_context_manager_service_perimeter)\r\n- [v5.X Commit for AccessContextManager](https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform-provider-google/commit/3e00cfbafa1ef13ebfd7e039bcec77407b824bfc#diff-b891c47e78be6f1eb5ea77648931c9bc38ea7b37bc06722bf0d6be3e6ea926cb)\n\nb/368651673",

This complexity translates into a torrential flood of data, making it nearly impossible for human engineers to effectively manage incidents at scale. The problem is multifaceted, a hydra-headed challenge that demands a new approach:\n\n- Alert Fatigue: On-call engineers are bombarded with a relentless barrage of alerts, many of which are false positives, low-priority notifications, or simply noise. This constant bombardment leads to alert fatigue\n\n- Context Scarcity: Alerts often provide minimal context, leaving responders to manually piece together the puzzle from disparate systems, like detectives at a crime scene with only a handful of clues. This \"context gap\" wastes valuable time, delays effective action, and increases the likelihood of misdiagnosis.\n\n- Manual Diagnostics: Troubleshooting remains a largely manual process, involving tedious tasks like sifting through mountains of log data, performing repetitive system checks, and frantically searching through outdated and often inaccurate runbooks. This is time-consuming, error-prone, and utterly unsustainable in the face of modern IT complexity.\n\n- Delayed Resolution: The combined effect of alert fatigue, context scarcity, and manual diagnostics results in prolonged incident resolution times, increased downtime, and significant business disruption. Every minute of downtime translates to lost revenue, lost productivity, and damaged reputation.\n\n\n### Solution\nKasper isn't just another monitoring tool; it's your AI-powered incident commander, automating and streamlining the entire incident lifecycle. By integrating seamlessly with alerting platforms like PagerDuty, communication hubs like Slack and the power of azure AI gents, Kasper provides a unified, context-rich, and actionable approach to incident management. \n\nAt its core, Kasper harnesses the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) to transcend mere alerting. It understands the incident's narrative, diagnoses the underlying problem with machine precision, prescribes the optimal solution – significantly reducing MTTR and paving the way for truly resilient systems. \n\n\n### Key Features\n- Real-time incident detection and analysis\n- Automated log processing and summarization\n- Intelligent remediation recommendations\n- Risk-based action execution\n- Human-in-the-loop approval for critical actions\n- Comprehensive incident tracking and history\n\n\n## Flow of Events\n\n![Alt text](https://media-hosting.imagekit.io/6061f447b9b74d3d/Flow%20of%20Events%20-%20visual%20selection.png?Expires=1841414581&Key-Pair-Id=K2ZIVPTIP2VGHC&Signature=wfAUiRC8mx7wTyO~2Y49d6GuTI6TUsA9nUDzEblKjATzaCC8oXKEBXN~juU-ItbGmCGi~D6~wj8Stg1yMdVYTvuodxJTjx7fpzjExtjcLwnVlZ-CXRJ9jAskLx7OAOxEeH7U77UkgxipNedZTZdQaFkhpy66o04I90mhCpCS9GUfJlzvJyVeTOd0VXR8TuxGXmMJQN8~mksAbFlaWXhHJVHQhskq3tsXiihri~rQV4EucZw8JAmxa9~iPS8pa-BXePuEpHXd40cBoUJwd6a5Sud2w4cgAVeOwxSl-YZrhr143QXA7kneWYxbopbpJnBXofy6rU5iFYo7PIavsuKuyw__)\n\n1. PagerDuty Alert Trigger: An incident occurs, triggering an alert in PagerDuty.\n\n2. Slack Notification: PagerDuty sends a notification about the new alert to a designated Slack channel.\n\n3. Kasper Bot Detection: Kasper's bot, constantly monitoring the specified Slack channel, detects the new PagerDuty alert notification.\n\n4. Initial Alert Summarization (Azure OpenAI): Upon detection, Kasper extracts the pd id and get the entire PD description. It sends it to Azure OpenAI for a concise summary of the PagerDuty alert details.\n\n5. Relevant Log Retrieval: Based on the incident details (e.g., affected service, hostname), Kasper automatically identifies and retrieves the relevant logs from the involved systems.\n\n6. Large Log Summarization (Azure Databricks):  Kasper utilizes Azure Databricks to efficiently process and summarize the key information and error patterns within the logs.\n\n7. Runbook Retrieval (Vector Database): With the summarized alert and log context, Kasper queries a vector database. This database stores embeddings of runbooks, allowing Kasper to perform a semantic search and retrieve the most relevant remediation steps based on the contextual understanding of the incident. There are various tools deployed in the azure databricks to optimize this search\n\n8. Risk Assessment: Kasper assesses the risk level associated with the retrieved remediation steps (e.g., commands like kubectl get pods is low risk, but commands like rm -rf . is high risk).\n\n9. Automated Execution (Low Risk): If the assessed risk of the recommended command is low, Kasper automatically executes the remediation steps on the affected system.\n\n10. Human Approval Request (High Risk): If the assessed risk is high, Kasper posts the summarized incident details, the proposed remediation steps, and the associated risk level to the Slack channel, awaiting explicit approval from an on-call engineer. Once there is enough confidence, this step also can be automated\n\n11. Execution Upon Approval: Once an engineer reviews and approves the remediation steps in Slack, Kasper proceeds to execute the commands on the affected system.\n\n12. Confirmation and Follow-up: After attempting remediation, Kasper posts a confirmation message in Slack, detailing the actions taken and the outcome. It may also suggest potential follow-up actions  based on the incident.\n\n\n## ⚙️ Technical Implementation\n\n### Architecture\n\n![Text](https://media-hosting.imagekit.io/445649bdad484c49/diagram-export-30-04-2025-08_46_52.png?Expires=1840600831&Key-Pair-Id=K2ZIVPTIP2VGHC&Signature=D~qhF8vNgoXHnd0OEEnhv-O-sfd7eHQ2RH3uiGvIgFFI1dGB82QVwcqahYw9gT12BJnaeWvpd99AeRtSuXCtXUOrvK02vpcG0nU-SMsh3mGuPGgm2V5grSO0kPLMlQi-v5kfNFlY51hOGAnmIi9cXq8MZqlF9iRTCDcbfEzfPPwXkI9Nv4vxqP6ZfK--r8KHaiwsypkt85~QFhqkWD2NK~rdfkNTFiad9bfma~i7-bjW8WisA-SgQFrpgQf3P5KuDZQZPefF1HMV2766SWlc9B5geaN7FHy0s~GWH1vc~XGVVMW-9hR1SIc-1M0VttuuZ5Ri5pwvJsClzFt2gUQCjQ__)\n\n### Tech Stack\n- Frontend:\n  -

Each auto-resolved alert saves about **20 minutes** of engineering effort.\n\n    - **Daily time savings:**: 600 alerts × 20 minutes = **12,000 minutes** = **200 hours/day**\n    - **Monthly savings (30 days):**: 200 hours/day × 30 = **6,000 hours/month**\n\n\n- 💰 People Cost Savings — `Up to $5.4M/Year`\n\n  - **At $50/hour for an engineer:**\n    - 6,000 hours × $50 = **$300,000/month** = **$3.6M/year**\n  \n  - **At $75/hour (fully loaded rate):**\n    - 6,000 hours × $75 = **$450,000/month** = **$5.4M/year**\n\n- ⚙️ Infra Savings — `Up to $216,000/year`\n\n    Unresolved incidents often keep expensive resources (like compute-heavy workloads) running unnecessarily, burning idle CPU/GPU cycles.\n\n    - **Average cost of idle infra per alert (CPU, GPU, storage, network):** ~$1–3 per alert/hour\n    - **Assume 300 of the 600 auto-resolved alerts/day involve infra components left running**\n    - **Estimate: $2/hour/alert × 1-hour delay**\n\n        - **Daily compute savings:**:  300 alerts × $2 = **$600/day**\n        - **Monthly compute savings:**: $600 × 30 = **$18,000/month** = **$216,000/year**\n\n### 📈 Combined Annual Efficiency Gains\n\n**Kasper can generate over `$5.6 million` in annual savings**, combining:\n- Engineering time savings\n- Reduced operational costs\n- Lower infrastructure waste\n\n## How Kasper fits the judging criteria\n\n1.

    "title": "Performance Analysis Report: Critical Database and Application Improvements Needed",
    "content": "# Vulnerable Notes Application - Performance Analysis Report\n_Generated on: May 11, 2025_\n\n## Executive Summary\n\nThis report presents a detailed performance analysis of the Vulnerable Notes application based on metrics collected through our Grafana MCP monitoring system. The analysis reveals several critical areas for improvement, particularly in database operations and request handling.\n\n## Current Performance Metrics\n\n### 1. HTTP Request Patterns\n- **GET /notes**\n  - Current Load: 0.09 requests/second\n  - Trend: Increasing (↑ from 0.01 to 0.09 req/s)\n  - Daily Estimated Load: ~7,776 requests/day\n\n- **POST /notes**\n  - Current Load: 0.09 requests/second\n  - Trend: Increasing (↑ from 0.03 to 0.09 req/s)\n  - Daily Estimated Load: ~7,776 requests/day\n\n- **POST /register**\n  - Current Load: 0 requests/second\n  - Trend: Decreasing (↓ from 0.02 to 0 req/s)\n  - Pattern: Registration activity has ceased\n\n### 2. Database Operations Performance\n\n#### Critical Issues:\n\n1. **Note Creation Operations**\n   - Average Duration: 157-182ms per operation\n   - Status: ⚠️ NEEDS IMMEDIATE ATTENTION\n   - Impact: High latency for note creation affecting user experience\n\n2. **Notes Listing Operations**\n   - Average Duration: 0.28-0.31ms per operation\n   - Status: ✅ PERFORMING WELL\n   - Impact: Efficient read operations\n\n3. **User Creation Operations**\n   - Average Duration: 0.12-0.20ms per operation\n   - Status: ✅ PERFORMING WELL\n   - Impact: Quick user registration process\n\n## Technical Bottlenecks\n\n### 1. Database Performance Issues\n\n#### Current Problems:\n- High latency in write operations (note creation)\n- No connection pooling implementation\n- Missing database indexing\n- Lack of query caching\n\n#### Impact:\n- Increased response times for users\n- Potential database connection exhaustion\n- Scalability limitations\n\n### 2. Application Architecture Limitations\n\n#### Current Problems:\n- No caching layer\n- Synchronous operations for all requests\n- Limited connection management\n- No rate limiting implementation\n\n#### Impact:\n- Higher server load\n- Increased database load\n- Potential for service degradation under load\n\n## Recommended Improvements\n\n### 1. Immediate Actions (High Priority)\n\n#### Database Optimizations\n```sql\n-- Add necessary indexes\nCREATE INDEX idx_notes_user_id ON notes(user_id);\nCREATE INDEX idx_notes_created_at ON notes(created_at);\nCREATE INDEX idx_notes_title ON notes(title);\n```\n\n#### Implementation Requirements:\n1. Add database connection pooling:\n   ```python\n   app.config['SQLALCHEMY_ENGINE_OPTIONS'] = {\n       'pool_size': 10,\n       'pool_recycle': 3600,\n       'pool_pre_ping': True\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. Implement caching layer:\n   ```python\n   from flask_caching import Cache\n   \n   cache_config = {\n       'CACHE_TYPE': 'redis',\n       'CACHE_REDIS_URL': 'redis://localhost:6379/0',\n       'CACHE_DEFAULT_TIMEOUT': 300\n   }\n   ```\n\n### 2. Short-term Improvements (Medium Priority)\n\n1. **Rate Limiting Implementation**\n   - Add rate limiting for API endpoints\n   - Suggested limit: 100 requests per minute per IP\n\n2. **Asynchronous Operations**\n   - Implement async operations for non-critical writes\n   - Add background task processing\n\n3. **Monitoring Enhancements**\n   - Add memory usage monitoring\n   - Implement CPU utilization tracking\n   - Set up alert thresholds\n\n### 3. Long-term Improvements (Low Priority)\n\n1. **Architecture Updates**\n   - Consider moving to a microservices architecture\n   - Implement event-driven architecture for better scaling\n   - Add read replicas for database\n\n2. **Performance Testing**\n   - Implement continuous performance testing\n   - Set up automated load testing\n   - Create performance benchmarks\n\n## Additional Monitoring Recommendations\n\n### 1. New Metrics to Track\n\n1. **System Metrics**\n   - Memory usage per process\n   - CPU utilization\n   - Disk I/O operations\n\n2. **Application Metrics**\n   - Request queue length\n   - Cache hit/miss ratio\n   - Database connection pool status\n\n3. **Business Metrics**\n   - User activity patterns\n   - Peak usage times\n   - Feature usage distribution\n\n### 2. Alert Thresholds\n\n| Metric | Warning Threshold | Critical Threshold |\n|--------|------------------|-------------------|\n| Note Creation Latency | > 100ms | > 200ms |\n| HTTP 5xx Errors | > 0.1% | > 1% |\n| Database Connections | > 80% pool | > 90% pool |\n| Memory Usage | > 80% | > 90% |\n| CPU Usage | > 70% | > 85% |\n\n## Site Reliability Engineering Tasks\n\n1. **Infrastructure**\n   - Implement auto-scaling based on metrics\n   - Set up database failover\n   - Configure load balancing\n\n2. **Monitoring**\n   - Set up centralized logging\n   - Implement distributed tracing\n   - Create custom Grafana dashboards\n\n3. **Incident Response**\n   - Create runbooks for common issues\n   - Set up on-call rotation\n   - Implement automated recovery procedures\n\n## Next Steps\n\n1. **Immediate Actions (24-48 hours)**\n   - Implement database indexing\n   - Set up connection pooling\n   - Add basic caching\n\n2. **Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)**\n   - Implement rate limiting\n   - Set up additional monitoring\n   - Create performance test suite\n\n3. **Long-term Goals (1-3 months)**\n   - Architectural improvements\n   - Automated scaling implementation\n   - Advanced monitoring and alerting\n\n## Contact\n\nFor questions or clarifications about this report, please contact the Performance Engineering team.\n\n---\nReport generated by Performance Monitoring System\nLast Updated: May 11, 2025\n",

    "title": "[Finished] Final Review and Postmortem of iOS data corruption issues and backend data recovery efforts",
    "content": "### original title: Fix of iOS data corruption issues, and retiring of necessary infrastructure\n\nThis posting serves as a notification of our recovery process and - thank gawd - final fix of and therefore eventual retirement of a complicated section of the backend codebase in the near future.  The development of this work is currently on our staged-updates branch, and the real documentation for those who want to know is inside this script:\nhttps://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe-backend/blob/staged-updates/scripts/script_that_recovers_some_ios_data.py\n\nTL;DR for the high level of what has been going on and what lead to this fix\n- iOS has had a data corruption issue for a long time.\n- After removing a certain library https://github.com/onnela-lab/beiwe-ios/issues/56 I was able to _finally_ resolve the issue.\n- There has been for quite some time now a component of beiwe-backend, running on the data processing server, that checked uploaded malformed files and made some attempts to decrypt them.  The underlying issue was that the decryption keys were not included in all files, but we had a heuristic we could use to find missing keys.  Think of it as the files getting cut in half.\n- There were still undecryptable files that looked well formed, but until specific development on Beiwe-iOS lead me to finally directly observe the cause I did not understand it.\n- Part of this discovery is that some keys had been stuck _in the wrong spots_ of uploaded files, and are therefore recoverable!\n- I then identified that one of my attempted fixes from quite a while ago (over a year, possibly even some 2022 work) had fixed one class of data issues - it was bad, white noise junk binary data - and transformed them into this issue where the key was present but in the wrong place.\n \nWe have more recoverable data than anticipated!\n\nI'm still working on this, I don't have a timeline because this isn't trivial and it came up in the middle of other work that I have pushed off and now have to attend to.\n\nI will try and update this issue with my progress.\n\nHere is the initial report on what this work consists of, copied directly from that file at time of original posting, it is necessarily technical in nature:\n\n```\n####################################################################################################\n# This script will process all the files in the PROBLEM_UPLOADS folder of AWS S3, which contains all\n# uploaded files that we were unable to decrypt. The existence of these files was due to a bug\n# limited to iOS devices only. There was a race-condition that affected all .csv files and it could\n# result in encryption keys failing to be present in uploaded files.\n#\n# 1) Sometimes the files were just junk, binary noise. I don't know when it was squashed, but it\n#    was. These files are completely unparseable and are never expected to be recovered.\n#\n# 2) Sometimes the encryption key was not present - but two files with the same name, only one\n#    containing the key, were uploaded. We added a capability to the backend to stash all decryption\n#    keys in the database associated with those file names. We could then use them to decrypt files\n#    lacking keys but matching the name. This required both an at-upload-time check and a periodic\n#    script that checks the recently uploaded bad files and check for any keys. Code for this can be\n#    found in /scripts/process_ios_no_decryption_key.py. The task for this script runs hourly.\n#\n# 3) Sometimes, and only observed as present in 2024 (after substantially rewriting iOS file-writing\n#    code + thorough testing) the encryption key WAS present _but on the wrong line in the file_.\n#    These files are fully recoverable, as are any instances of 2) that lost their keys to these\n#    malformatted files.\n#################################################################################################\n###\n#\n# THIS SCRIPT...\n# - Finds, decrypts, and sets up for processing all files affected by issue 3.\n#\n# - RE-processes all uploaded files that experienced issue 2.\n#   - This is incredibly wasteful.\n#   - This is because I can't work out how to determine if any given file has been processed at an\n#     unknown time in the past.\n#   - we could look at the created_on timestamp of the decryption key and make a heuristic guess???\n#\n# - Has been written with the intention of removing the architecture over in\n#   /scripts/process_ios_no_decryption_key.py because We Have Fixed The Bug.\n# \n# - Iterates over So Many Files that we can't even cache file names in memory.\n#\n# - At this point I'm considering making it a distributed celery task.\n#\n# - IS NOT FINISHED. I have been working on it on our staging server, its just so complex and gross.\n#\n# - Should probably delete the files in PROBLEM_UPLOADS after we are definitely completely done\n#   processing them.\n#\n# - I don't know what the payoff actually is for this. It \"seems like a lot\" to me watching test\n#   versions of the script execute on staging, but I would be astonished if it is 10%.\n#   More data more better though, so its worth doing.\n####################################################################################################\n```",

    "title": "Incident Timeline Analysis: Apex Financial Security Breach-  Intel Source of Truth @ Log Files 1.xlsx",
    "content": "Incident Timeline Analysis: Apex Financial Security Breach\n\nIntel Source of Truth @ Log Files 1.xlsx\n\nOverview\nApex Financial experienced a critical security incident involving a well-resourced Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) group known as APT 52, which specializes in financial espionage. The attack was initiated via a spear-phishing campaign targeting employees in the finance and IT departments. The objective of this attack was to exfiltrate sensitive financial data and intellectual property related to a proprietary trading algorithm while establishing long-term persistence within the network.\nTimeline of Events\nInitial Compromise\n•\n2025-03-06T17:29:36 – A failed login attempt was recorded for user 'analyst1' from 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.50.\n•\n2025-03-06T17:34:36 – A successful login was recorded for 'analyst1' from the same source IP (192.168.1.10). This indicates that the attacker may have successfully obtained the user's credentials.\nPrivilege Escalation & Credential Abuse\n•\n2025-03-06T18:04:36 – A Pass-the-Hash (PtH) attack was detected from 192.168.1.10 to 192.168.1.50, signaling an attempt to escalate privileges and move laterally within the network.\n•\n2025-03-06T18:29:36 – A Kerberos ticket request from an unusual host (192.168.1.100) was detected, suggesting an attempt to gain further unauthorized access through Kerberoasting or Golden Ticket attacks.\nPotential Domain Administrator Targeting\n•\n2025-03-06T19:44:36 – An account lockout attempt for 'domain_admin' from 192.168.1.10 was logged. This suggests the attacker was attempting brute-force attacks or trying multiple authentication attempts with compromised credentials.\nLateral Movement\nMultiple successful login attempts were recorded across various workstations and servers between 17:00 and 18:28, involving different user accounts and IP addresses:\n•\nSuccessful logins for standard users such as 'john.doe', 'jane.smith', and multiple generic usernames (e.g., 'user5', 'user39', 'user17').\n•\nThese activities suggest that the attacker was leveraging valid credentials to move laterally and establish persistence.\ntimestamp\nlog_type source_ip destination_ip\nevent_description severity 2025-03-06 17:00:37\nauthentication 192.168.1.20 192.168.1.50\nSuccessful login for user 'john.doe' INFO

unusual host WARNING 2025-03-06 19:44:37\nauthentication 192.168.1.10 192.168.1.50\nAccount lockout attempt for 'domain_admin' WARNING\n\nLog Type Breakdown\n\n ● Endpoint Security: 28 events ● Authentication: 26 events ● Email Gateway: 14 events\nSeverity Levels ● INFO: 56 events ● HIGH: 4 events ● WARNING: 3 events ● MEDIUM: 3 events ● CRITICAL: 2 events\n\nMost events are informational, but there are 9 high/critical severity incidents to pay attention to.\n\nEvent Timeline (Hourly)\n\nTop 10 Source IPs Top 10 Destination IPs\n\nAnalysis & Impact\n1.\nInitial Attack Vector:\na.\nThe incident started with a successful phishing attack that allowed the attacker to steal the credentials of 'analyst1'.\nb.\nA malicious macro (T1204.002) was likely executed on WORKSTATION-01, enabling the attacker to establish an initial foothold.\n2.\nPersistence and Privilege Escalation:\na.\nThe Pass-the-Hash attack indicates an attempt to move laterally with elevated privileges.\nb.\nThe Kerberos ticket request from an unusual host suggests an attempt to maintain persistence within the domain.\n3.\nLateral Movement & Data Exfiltration:\na.\nThe attack involved multiple successful logins across the network, indicating an effort to establish a widespread foothold.\nb.\nThe attempt to compromise the domain administrator account suggests an effort to gain full control over the infrastructure.\n\n\nRecommendations for Incident Response\n1.\nImmediate Containment Measures:\na.\nIsolate WORKSTATION-01 (192.168.1.10) and any other affected machines.\nb.\nReset passwords and revoke access tokens for 'analyst1' and other compromised accounts.\nc.\nConduct a forensic memory dump of the affected systems to identify any active malware.\n2.\nThreat Hunting & Eradication:\na.\nAnalyze EDR and SIEM logs for any further suspicious activity.\nb.\nInvestigate scheduled tasks or registry modifications to detect persistence mechanisms (T1053).\nc.\nRevoke any suspicious Kerberos tickets and audit the Key Distribution Center (KDC) logs.\n3.\nHardening & Long-term Security Measures:\na.\nImplement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all privileged accounts.\nb.\nImprove email filtering to prevent spear-phishing attacks.\nc.\nConduct security awareness training for employees to recognize phishing attempts.\nd.\nEnforce least privilege access policies to limit lateral movement potential.\n\n\nConclusion\nAPT 52 successfully compromised an employee’s credentials via a phishing attack, enabling them to execute malicious macros and perform credential abuse techniques like Pass-the-Hash and Kerberoasting. The attackers attempted to escalate privileges by targeting the domain administrator account, signaling a clear attempt at full domain compromise. Given the nature of the attack, it is imperative that Apex Financial takes immediate action to contain the breach, conduct a thorough forensic analysis, and enhance its security posture to prevent future incidents.\n\nEmail Notification\n\nSubject:\nImportant Alert Regarding Email Phishing\n\nBody:\n\nDear Team,\n\nWe want to inform you that a phishing email attack has been detected within our environment.
