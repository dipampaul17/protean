# Project: Protean - Infrastructure Pattern Discovery Engine

## Week 1 Mission
Build a pattern extraction pipeline that:
1. Recognizes 10+ canonical patterns with 70%+ accuracy
2. Discovers 5-10 genuinely unknown patterns (novelty signal)
3. Creates embeddings that cluster patterns meaningfully
4. Completes full pipeline in <6 CPU-hours (efficiency matters)

## Core Insight
We're building a pattern genome - a learnable representation of how infrastructure evolves under stress.
Every unknown pattern we extract is a potential breakthrough waiting to be evolved in Week 2.

## Key Differentiator
Not just matching patterns, but discovering the latent space of ALL POSSIBLE resilience patterns.

## Runtime Constraints
- Synthetic generation: 2 CPU-hours max
- Pattern extraction: 3 CPU-hours max  
- Validation: 1 CPU-hour max
- Use tmpfs, pre-pulled images, fast hashes
